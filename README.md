**Schmorn** is a simple text adventure game made in Java as part of the **4IT101** course at the **Prague University of Economics and Business (VŠE)**.

The game tells a story of Schmorn, a weak, inept and power-hungry prince, who gets turned into a worm as a punishment for seeking unlimited power from Oglunda, a powerful witch. The witch casts Schmorn into his Royal Well, forcing him to crawl through the Royal Underground to reach the surface and get his revenge.
